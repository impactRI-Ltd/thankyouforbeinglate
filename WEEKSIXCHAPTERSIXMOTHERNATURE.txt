<h2>WEEK SIX CHAPTER SIX MOTHER NATURE<h2>
<p>This chapter is the last one of Part II ‘Accelerating’. Rminder: Part II of the book will be about how the Machine - the world - works. Part III tries to explain how the forces discussed in part II will affect people and cultures and what the most appropriate response might be. </p>
<p>Metaphors tend to be fluid. While at first Friedman described the world as ‘Machine’, this time it is anthropomorphized to <strong>Mother Nature</strong> having a very high and threatening fever. Friedman gives examples from the Middle East and Greenland illustrating the seriousness of the situation.</p>
<p>While ‘officially’ we live in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene">Holocene</a>, that epoch during which climate and Mother Earth were so ideal that we came out of our caves and built great civilizations, it seems we enter now a new era, sometimes called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocene">Anthropocene</a>. This time humans have a marked impact on Mother Earth (changing climate, dwindling biodiversity, deforestation, changing biogeochemical flows affecting the oceans). This became obvious since mid previous century and now the impact is accelerating, <strong>boundaries of no-return are being reached</strong>. </p>
<p>When we said that technology evolves exponentially, we told the story of the chessboard and the grains of rice being doubled on each square, exploding as we reach the second half of the board. The same thing - <strong>exponential change</strong> - happens to Mother Earth. It’s not good.</p> 
<p>At the same time the <strong>population growth</strong> is out of control. People live longer, also in poor countries, but still far too many people are being born. While Nature and technology change at an exponential rate, poor countries are confronted with corrupt regimes, poor education, inequality in gender relations, and rapidly increasing populations. Young angry males are prone to radicalism, many of them try to get to the affluent West, causing political and cultural clashes. We ain’t seen nothing yet.</p>
<p>[Will we be able to use the accelerating technology as an enabler in order to solve or at least mitigate the terrible problems caused by entering the Anthropocene? For instance, when Nigeria is on its way to become the third-largest country on the planet in terms of population, will we able to offer education to the young people there, whether or not the political regime supports this? 'We' meaning literally 'we' as the world becomes so small - Nigerian youngsters flock to Coursera to get a better education, but what about those who lack the necessary preparation to do this succesfully? Can we develop programs helping them?]</p>
